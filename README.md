# CURSOR Education Homeworks

## Homework #1
1. Task 1 - implement a fire department with the help of concurrency. There are threads which wait for a signal and they react when the signal comes.
2. Task 2 - producer-consumer. One thread produces data, other threads consume and handle.
3. Task 3 - make 5 threads. Every thread should generate songs (every thread is a certain genre). Need to save these songs to provide an ability to join them.
