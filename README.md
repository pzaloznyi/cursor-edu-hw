# CURSOR Education Homeworks

## Homework #1
1. [Task 1](src/HW1/task1) - implement a fire department with the help of concurrency. There are threads which wait for a signal and they react when the signal comes.
2. [Task 2](src/HW1/task2) - producer-consumer. One thread produces data, other threads consume and handle.
3. [Task 3](src/HW1/task3) - make 5 threads. Every thread should generate songs (every thread is a certain genre). Need to save these songs to provide an ability to join them.
